General Usage Notes

This is the final version of a lab I worked on for my CSC2310 class (Object-Oriented Programming) in 2017. It includes up to 3 AIs to play against if you are playing alone.
This lab project took place over the course of one semester consisting of weekly assignments applying new OOP concepts to the game in order to make it fully functional.
